            Tarsiers are small, nocturnal primates native to Southeast Asia, known for their incredibly large eyes and excellent jumping abilities. These tiny creatures, often no bigger than a human hand, have long fingers and toes, which help them grip tree branches as they leap from one to another in search of insects, their primary food source. Tarsiers can rotate their heads almost 180 degrees, similar to owls, allowing them to spot prey and predators in the dark. Their huge eyes give them excellent night vision, making them efficient hunters. Though shy and elusive, tarsiers play a vital role in their ecosystems, and their distinctive appearance makes them a fascinating species for zoo visitors to observe.
