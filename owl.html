            Owls are fascinating, nocturnal birds of prey known for their large, 
            forward-facing eyes and ability to rotate their heads up to 270 degrees. 
            They have a distinctive, silent flight due to the specialized structure of their feathers, 
            which allows them to sneak up on prey. Owls are equipped with sharp talons and a strong beak, 
            making them formidable hunters, primarily feeding on small mammals, insects, and other birds. 
            Their keen sense of hearing and excellent night vision give them an edge in low-light conditions, 
            making them masters of the night sky. With over 200 species worldwide, owls are symbols of wisdom and mystery in many cultures.
